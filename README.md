# Comprehensive DNA Sequence Analysis and Variant Detection

## Overview

This project presents a set of bioinformatics tools designed to analyze DNA sequences, detect genetic variants, and construct phylogenetic trees to explore evolutionary relationships between species. The project includes several key bioinformatics tasks such as DNA sequence manipulation, genetic code translation, sequence alignment, variant calling (SNPs, indels), and phylogenetic tree construction.

This project showcases a comprehensive understanding of bioinformatics concepts, with implementations of core algorithms and methods for real-world biological data analysis.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:
1. **DNA Sequence Validation & Manipulation**: Implement methods to manipulate and validate DNA sequences, including operations such as reverse, complement, and reverse-complement.
2. **Genetic Code Translation**: Translate DNA sequences into amino acid sequences, accounting for reading frames and potential frame shifts.
3. **Sequence Alignment**: Implement local and global sequence alignment algorithms (Smith-Waterman, Needleman-Wunsch) to find similarities and differences between DNA sequences.
4. **Variant Calling**: Detect genetic variants (SNPs, insertions, deletions) by comparing a sample sequence with a reference genome.
5. **Phylogenetic Tree Construction**: Build and visualize phylogenetic trees to explore the evolutionary relationships between different DNA sequences.
6. **Data Visualization**: Use plots and graphs to visualize GC content, codon usage, and sequence similarities.

## Key Features

- **DNA Sequence Manipulation**: Functions for sequence validation (reverse, complement, reverse-complement) and visual representation of sequence data.
- **Translation**: Functions that translate DNA sequences into protein sequences and incorporate reading frame shifts.
- **Alignment**: Algorithms for sequence alignment, including global (Needleman-Wunsch) and local (Smith-Waterman) alignments, as well as visualizing the alignment results.
- **Variant Detection**: Methods to identify genetic variants (e.g., SNPs, indels) by comparing sample DNA sequences to a reference genome.
- **Phylogenetic Tree Construction**: Algorithms for constructing and visualizing phylogenetic trees from aligned DNA sequences, utilizing distance matrices and tree-building algorithms.
- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Plots to visualize GC content, codon usage, sequence similarities, and phylogenetic relationships.

## Methods

### 1. **DNA Sequence Manipulation**
   - Implement reverse, complement, and reverse-complement functions using Python.
   - Validate and manipulate DNA sequences to check for valid nucleotide compositions (A, T, G, C).

### 2. **Genetic Code Translation**
   - Translate a given DNA sequence into the corresponding amino acid sequence using the standard genetic code.
   - Account for reading frame shifts and handle sequences with multiple potential reading frames.

### 3. **Sequence Alignment**
   - Implement Needleman-Wunsch (global) and Smith-Waterman (local) sequence alignment algorithms using dynamic programming.
   - Use these alignments to compare DNA sequences and highlight conserved regions.
   - Visualize alignments using tools like Biopython.

### 4. **Variant Calling**
   - Compare a sample DNA sequence with a reference sequence to detect mutations.
   - Identify SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) and indels (insertions/deletions) by comparing aligned sequences.
   - Output a list of identified variants with their positions and types.

### 5. **Phylogenetic Tree Construction**
   - Build phylogenetic trees based on sequence similarity using algorithms like Neighbor-Joining or UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean).
   - Visualize the tree using Biopython's Phylo module and draw the tree with graphical tools like Matplotlib.

### 6. **Data Visualization**
   - Plot GC content across different sequences to identify potential gene-rich or GC-poor regions.
   - Visualize codon usage frequency in a given sequence and create a plot for the most frequent codons.
   - Use hierarchical clustering or similarity matrices to visualize sequence similarities between species.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language used to implement bioinformatics algorithms.
- **Biopython**: A key library for handling biological data, including sequence manipulation, alignment, and phylogenetic tree construction.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization and plotting.
- **NumPy**: Used for efficient handling of sequences and mathematical operations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive code and results visualization.

## Example Usage

1. **DNA Sequence Manipulation**:
   ```python
   sequence = "ATGCGT"
   print(reverse_sequence(sequence))  # Output: "TGCGTA"
   print(complement_sequence(sequence))  # Output: "TACGCA"
   print(reverse_complement(sequence))  # Output: "ACGCAT"
